- ITICS40 tool:
	- your tool will have the following features:
		1- Parse access.log files and extract all information [task from lab]
		2- Directory monitoring [task from lab]
		3- It will scan a range of IPs [TCP & UDP]. after gaining the open ports, pass them to Nmap with -sC -sV options and parse the output to the user.
		4- Attack detection [listen to unknown ports and check if there is someone try to connect], send a mail and block the IP [Block using iptc module to add in iptables]
		5- Parse any link and extract all tags, comments, domains, subdomains and full URLs from it.
		6- Users will have the choice to write any output to a file.

Notes: 
- I will receive a GitHub link from each one to view his/her project on Github.
- I will not receive any project that was written without exception handling or functions.
- feel free to test your program against static inputs but the last version will be able to take an input from the user to proceed in any feature.

The deadline will be 25/1/2020
